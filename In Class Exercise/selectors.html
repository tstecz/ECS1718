        <p> Hello my name is Tommy.</p>
        <div id="container">
            <p>To complete this assignment, you will need to create your own version of this page and save it in your c9 account.  You can copy / paste the code, but you should create your own folder named InClassExamples and make sure that you name your files the same as mine.</p>
            <p>To view the code go here: <a href="https://ide.c9.io/rberg/ecs1718_period7">https://ide.c9.io/rberg/ecs1718_period7</a></p>
            <h2>Assignment: On your webpage, answer the questions and change images/content.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Insert your own image instead of the el-capitan image that was originally inserted.  <em>Do NOT</em> use the url link, instead find an immage that you would like to link, download it and insert it into the page, inside of the container div</li>
                <li>There are three types of selectors, go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">w3schools Syntax</a> and name them here: (also include which tag each of these are associated with in this example)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em a class="purple">//The ID Selector (#container) //</em></li>
                    <li><em a class="purple">//Element Selector (body)//</em></li>
                    <li><em a class="purple">//Class Selector (.center)//</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Add a paragraph tag outside of the container and put some school appropriate text in it.</li>
                <li>What color was that text and why?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>color: <em a class="purple">//White//</em></li>
                    <li>why? <em a class="purple">//It is white becuse the css for inside the container is different from the css outside of the container.//</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>When finished, turn in the url to the google classroom post for today.</li>
            </ol>
